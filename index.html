                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello everyone! I am a student passionate about programming and technology. I have a deep interest in data science, especially in the fields of artificial intelligence and web development. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by how computers work and how to create new things through code.</p>
                
                <p>During my university years, I focused on learning programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I have participated in multiple projects, including developing mobile applications, creating data visualization tools, and designing responsive websites. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical abilities but also cultivated my teamwork and problem-solving skills.</p>
                
                <p>Besides programming, I enjoy reading technology books, participating in coding competitions, and exploring new technology trends. I believe that technology can change the world, and I hope to be a part of this transformation. Through continuous learning and practice, I am committed to becoming an excellent software developer and creating value for society.</p>
                
                <p>This website is my platform to showcase my skills and share knowledge. I will regularly update my projects and learning insights, hoping to connect and grow with like-minded friends. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find useful information here!</p>
